# **ChatGroq: Your AI-Powered Information Hub**

ChatGroq is a Streamlit application designed to serve as an **AI-powered information hub**, leveraging various components from the `langchain` library and integrating Google's Generative AI embeddings for answering questions based on provided context.

## Overview

ChatGroq enables users to input prompts or questions, and it retrieves relevant information from documents using advanced AI models and search capabilities.

## Key Components

### 1. Environment Setup

The application uses **Streamlit** for the user interface and relies on Python libraries such as `dotenv` for environment variable management.

### 2. Google's Generative AI Embeddings

Integrates **Google's Generative AI embeddings** to enhance natural language understanding and response generation capabilities.

### 3. Streamlit Session State

Utilizes **Streamlit's `session_state`** to store and manage stateful data across user interactions, ensuring seamless retrieval and processing of information.

### 4. ChatGroq Initialization

Initializes a **ChatGroq instance** configured with specific API keys and models from the `langchain` library, facilitating sophisticated question-answering functionalities.

## Usage

To use ChatGroq:

1. Ensure all necessary dependencies (`streamlit`, `langchain`, `google-api-python-client`, etc.) are installed in your Python environment.
2. Set up environment variables (`GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`) to authenticate and configure external services.
3. Run the Streamlit application (`streamlit run app.py`) and interact with the provided UI to input prompts and receive accurate responses based on contextual information.

## Notes

- Customize and extend the application by modifying the prompt templates, integrating additional AI models, or enhancing document retrieval capabilities.
- Ensure compliance with API usage policies and handle sensitive information securely when integrating external services like Google's APIs.
